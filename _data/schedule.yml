      description: "Vendors and related technology are what they are - they might stop the weak attackers, and get you a checkmark, but they may not keep you from having Brian Krebs writing about you. Advanced and working AI is at least a month away, so we need to bridge the gap somehow.

We’ll talk (and cry together) about all sorts of existing technologies, and their limitations, and what they are best served for. Then, more importantly, we’ll talk about alternative methods to fill in the gaps until our future AI overlords save us all."

      description: "Marketplaces on the “darkweb” have captured the imagination of journalists; with promises of illicit goods of every variety and total anonymity. However, with news of recent busts of (in)famous dark market websites, it's become obvious that running a dark market website, without getting caught, requires thorough planning. Explored will be a number of the technical and logistical challenges one would need to address in setting up their own marketplace. We will provide solutions to many. We will also discuss the economics at play and what’s actually available in such marketplaces as a result."
