      title: "My Perspective: Authentication & Authorization using JWT"
      description: "There is an ever-growing need for security in our software applications; our users are providing more and more private and personal information. It is imperative that this information be secure, and it is up to us as software developers to make sure of this. As a junior developer it is easy to push security off until a later date; this will often lead to complications and is quite possible that you will end up changing the architecture down the road. The purpose of my talk is to give a brief introduction, and my own personal experience with authentication and authorization through the use of JSON Web Tokens (JWT)."

      description: "Marketplaces on the “darkweb” have captured the imagination of journalists; with promises of illicit goods of every variety and total anonymity. However, with news of recent busts of (in)famous dark market websites, it's become obvious that running a dark market website, without getting caught, requires thorough planning. Explored will be a number of the technical and logistical challenges one would need to address in setting up their own marketplace. We will provide solutions to many. We will also discuss the economics at play and what’s actually available in such marketplaces as a result."
